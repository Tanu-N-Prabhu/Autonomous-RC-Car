# Autonomous-RC-Car
In this project, the old radio-controlled car will be made autonomous by adding an ultrasonic sensor to it. This ultrasonic sensor helps in avoiding obstacles in front of the car by emitting ultrasonic sound waves. This autonomous car detects the obstacle and avoids collision by changing its direction of movement. The ultrasonic sensor sends the data to the Arduino micro-controller and then the micro-controller with the help of a motor-shield controls the movements of the wheels via DC motors<h2>The front view of my RC car</h2>

 # Build Instructions
 
 The breadboard view gives you a strong clarity of how different components are connected together, by looking at this you can aslo build similar design for your project.

# Requirements and Materials
<h4> Libraries required for the project are </h4>
 <b>1. ADAFRUIT MOTOR-SHIELD LIBRARY</b> : (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library/zipball/master)

<h4> The materials required for this project are as follows.</h2>

1. 1 x RC Car
2. 1 x Ultrasonic Sensor.
3. 1 x Ada-fruit Motor Shield L239D. 
4. 3 x LED for the brake lights.
5. 2 x Battery holders.
6. 2 x Bread board for placement of Arduino Uno and Ultrasonic sensor.
7  3 x 100k resistor
8. 10 x AA Massive amount of batteries (10 Volts).
9. 1 x Push-Button if needed.
<h3> Installing Arduino Software </h3>

1. You can download the IDE from here : (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).

2. After you install the IDE click here to learn more about it : (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).

<h4> Usage </h4>

1. Upload the code to the Arduino.
2. Power both the Arduino and the Motor-shield via batteries.
3. Then the car moves to the front automatically, it then stops if it finds an obstacle, and then goes back for a bit, and then turns to the left and again checks for the obstacle, otherwise, it turns to the right this time and further continues to go in the same       direction.
4. This would be cool to watch because it automatically does all these things by itself.
5. Last, donâ€™t forget to remove the batteries from the battery holder, sometimes both the Arduino and the Motor-Shield can become really hot after an immense usage.
